# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on Metasploitable 2

## Objective
To identify, analyze, and exploit vulnerabilities in a deliberately vulnerable system (Metasploitable 2) in a controlled lab environment.

## Scope
- Target: Metasploitable 2
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Network: Host-only
- Testing Type: Black-box testing

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Searchsploit
- Metasploit Framework
- Kali Linux

## Methodology
1. Reconnaissance
2. Vulnerability Scanning
3. Enumeration
